Computational Physics paper on the Structure of White Dwarf Stars

This paper was written in 1997 as the second project (out of 5) in a 3rd year undegraduate
physics class I took in Computational Physics. 

The paper investigate the use of numerical integration methods for computing the masss
and density profiles of white dwarf stars with Sirius B and 40 Eri B used as case studies. 

The paper was reformatted to use an IEEE template and an abstract was added.
So apart from the adding of figures/table environments and changing the source code 
listings to use a modern LaTeX package (listings) the paper is otherwise unchanged.

The code for the class had to be written in FORTRAN 77 which I have included in the repository, 
but I haven't got around to getting a FORTRAN compiler to compile it up and see if it still works.
